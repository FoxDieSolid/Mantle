Mantle
======

Mantle is a framework for building massively scalable applications that can be hosted either on-premises or on a variety of public cloud providers including Azure and AWS. By completely separating domain-specific business logic from the underlying infrastructure Mantle helps mitigate the concerns associated with cloud fragmentation.
